    	This season revolves around the story of a witch coven in New Orleans and how they deal with the numerous issues they have, the biggest of these issues having something to do with dethroning their current Supreme Fiona Goode as Fiona's quest for life everlasting and her efforts to keep her position prove catastrophic for the future of the coven. They also have to deal with the looming threat of Voodooists and witch hunters, as well as their own personal battles such as their relationships with each other and being able to fully embrace and understand their identities.

    	The first half of the season revolves around the select survivors of the Armageddon in Outpost 3. Their struggles that stem from the scarcity of resources and the tyrannical rule of the Outpost matriarch Wilhemina Venable are depicted during this time. Later, after the residents of the Outpost are seemingly all killed, we find out that two of the residents in the Outpost, Coco and Mallory, are pivotal pieces of the New Orleans witch coven's contigency plan after their grand scheme to foil Michael Langdon before he even brings about the Apocalypse fails. We are then taken on a narrative that revolves around the New Orleans coven and a new warlcok coven and how their struggle for the top spot in the magical hierarchy led to the rise of Michael Langdon as the ender of days.
