        Character Analysis:
        <br>
        Madison is an incredibly powerful witch who's able to perform six out of the Seven Wonders. Madison was an incredibly selfish, narcissistic, and sociopathic character who had no regard for the feelings of those around her. She was quite a sharp-tongued and violent person as well. She also had huge tendencies to betray those around her as proven by the time when she ditched Zoe Lavern when morgue security showed up and the time when she refused to resurrect Zoe despite having the power to do so. Madison's also something of a sore loser herself. She's shown to lash out whenever she gets bested, just like when she found out that Kyle and Zoe have fallen in love with each other and she threw a lamp at the back of Zoe's head. However, despite these undesirable qualities and actions, there's just something about her that still made her likeable. Maybe it was the way that she carried herself and her toxic traits in such a poised and confident manner that it didn't incite distaste and hatred. It could also be because a lot of people are into the "mean, pretty blonde diva" demographic. 
        <br>
        Nevertheless, her characterization as an incredibly contemptible person didn't stop her from captivating lots of people in the fanbase. She was especially more appealing during her character development in Apocalypse. She actively looked out for the coven after her third resurrection and was clear in her goal to redeem herself from everything that she's done and said by playing an effectual role in combatting the Anti-Christ. She was kinder, more compassionate and even sacrificed herself for the better good which was quite refreshing to see from a character that was shown to be nothing short of cruel.

        Character Analysis:
        <br>
        Being the Supreme, Cordelia possesses immense magical strength that has been previously repressed by her mother's degrading treatment. Once Myrtle Snow, her mother figure, gave her a few nudges, however, she showcased this strength flawlessly and rightfully claimed her position in the coven as the new Supreme after Fiona. Cordelia is also an extremely affectionate and caring person, acting as the students' mother figure as well as a mentor who eases young witches into embracing and taking control of their own power. She also regards the coven with utmost importance to the point that she even took her own life to provide rising Supreme Mallory with enough power to go back in time to stop the Apocalypse from happening.
        <br>
        Cordelia's not above breaking the rules for the sake of the coven either, like the time when she reversed Myrtle Snow's death despite the latter's explicit instructions not to bring her back as Cordelia needed guidance in combatting an oncoming threat that she saw in a vision. This compassion is amplified a lot more when it comes to those that she cares for on a much more personal level, even to her mother Fiona who she loathes and despises for the most part. Sometimes, however, she is way too nice for her own good and she always went to the defense of people she had any semblance of affection for, like how she defended Fiona from Myrtle's accusations of murder or consistently defended her husband Hank, who's actually a witch hunter who was sent to infiltrate the coven and the Academy, from Fiona. All in all, she's a compassionate and nurturing person who will do anything in her power, even beyond her power, to protect everything and everyone that she cares for.

        <br>
        Character Analysis:
        <br>
       As a Supreme, it is expected of her to have a powerful magical prowess. She got so obssessed with the strength and power, as well as the authority and influence that comes with being the Supreme that she came up with the most mischievious of plans to extend and keep her reign. Despite her seemingly affectionate displays towards certain characters, almost none of that is sincere. She is incapable of loving and would put herself above anything else. She was simply doing it all because she deems them useful in her plans. One of the only reasons why she would keep anyone close to her is primarily because she can find some use for them with that use being anything that she can benefit from. A good example of this would be when she started being domestic with Queenie and filled her head with sweet nothings because she needed her help to frame Myrtle as the one who threw acid on Cordelia's face. Another example would be how she consistently entertained the Axe Man's sexual advances as means of trying to "feel something" before she died and later because he needed him to function as an attack dog that can help her kill the witch hunters and as a pivotal piece in framing her own death. 
       <br>
       Another reason why Fiona would even bother to keep someone around her is because she wants to get rid of them. She keeps certain people close to her until she finally has a plan to eliminate them as shown when she seemingly took Madison in as a protege when she started manifesting other abilities only to later mistakenly prevent her from replacing her as the Supreme. She also gets rid of people that she considers useless although in a more non-chalant fashion. Despite how complicatedly terrible she is, however, she suprisingly still has a softer side as proven by the time that she resurrected a mother's baby and telling the mother to cherish the baby as Fiona failed to do with Cordelia. She knows and admits that she has lots of lapses in being a parent but she also says that she can't change herself even if she wanted to. In another respect, she somewhat cares for the coven and personally takes charge in getting rid of their enemies although the people around her are easily distracted by her more prominent cunning and selfish side. She also has inclinations towards witches that are able to fight and defend themselves.

        Character Analysis:
        <br>
		Zoe is a powerful witch that was able to perform the Seven Wonders save pyrokinesis. Her character began as an extremely shy, quiet and sweet girl who didn't do well under pressure. Fiona Goode even distastefully called her soft and emotional. Zoe immediately proved this notion wrong when she seamlessly took charge of the household when Marie Laveau's army of zombies stormed the Academy and successfully foiled the attack. Through her stay in Miss Robichaux's, she grew into an empowered young witch with an extensive knowledge and regard for the craft and her status as a witch. Overtime, she has also formed a familial rapport with the other witches of the coven and would being to treat them and care for them as if they were her actual sisters and matrons. She's also seen to have an upright moral compass as signified by her defection from her and Madison's acquaintanceship due to Madison's narcissistic and selfish behavior and her inability to euthanize a newly resurrected Kyle who was suffering from intense mental instability. When Cordelia rose to the position of Supreme, Zoe was granted a position in the Witches' Council. As an effect, she blossomed into a confident woman who served as an effecient and responsible mentor and friend for all the witches that came after her.

        Character Analysis:
        <br>
		Queenie is a powerful witch who performed six (formally, five) out of the Seven Wonders. She is a tough, headstrong character who values respect above anything else. When she was first introduced, she was cagey and she felt a bit isolated due to her being the only African-American student at Robichaux's. She  didn't trust any of the people around her as she's afraid of not gaining any semblance of respect from the other witches and refrained from forming a rapport with Cordelia and Madison except for Nan. It didn't help that she was the only one who had a Voodoo-esque ability and heritage. She also had a history of being ridiculed for her weight but was never knocked down by this. Out of the household members, she's the only one who can manage to exchange verbal blows with and shut down Madison Montgomery. Her tough disposition extends to her sentiments regarding violence in which she does not shy away from hurting people and getting her hands dirty. Overtime, she is able to overcome her trust issues and starts to form relationships with her fellow witches and later views them as her own family. It is also interesting to note that despite her adamant nature and her past experiences, Queenie believes that there is good in everyone. This is especially prominent in her efforts to educate Delphine LaLaurie on her prejudiced views against black people.

        Character Analysis:
        <br>
		Misty is a powerful witch that possesses the rarely seen power of resurgence. She has a huge inclination towards nature and would often be found tending to her garden in the Lousiana swamp while listening to Stevie Nicks who she severely idolizes to the point that she even fainted when Fiona introduced her personally to Stevie. She also despises and punishes those who tamper and destroy nature. She's a spiritual Christian woman as well as signified by her attendance in a church group and her focused gaze on Joan Ramsey's crucifix on the wall of her house. Although she lacks a formal education and a proper lifestyle, Misty is not as naive as her background makes it out to be. She isn't easily tricked to some degree although she was unable to tell the difference between her personal hell and reality, hindering her from getting out of Descensum. Her whole character radiates passiveness and she may seem like a pacifist but she can be extremely brutal when it comes to conflict. This hidden animosity is showcased when she seizes control of the minds of alligators with her Concilium to kill two poachers and when she brutally inflicts injuries on a helpless Madison with her bare hands as a form of revenge for trying to bury her alive.

        Character Analysis:
        <br>
		Nan is a witch who had an affinity in psychic abilities or abilities that work with and affect the mind, such as telekinesis and clairvoyance. She is a sweet girl, if not a bit ominous. Despite her unconventional appearance brought upon by her condition, she manages to win the hearts of those around her with the charm of her kindness as proven by Luke's romantic feelings for her. Nan usually acts as the mediator between fights as seen when she stopped Madison and Queenie's conflict during dinner from escalating even further. She makes it a habit to embellish in whatever her clairvoyance picks up on, may it be the thoughts of a person or a feeling that tells her to act upon the reading in a certain way. She's usually the first one to feel that something is going on or find out the truth of a certain instance. Although Nan is passive for the most part, she will retaliate when she feels like someone is subverting her and will not think twice to inflict serious injuries on the people she despise.

        Character Analysis:
        <br>
		Myrtle is a crafty and powerful witch with sophisticated and luxurious preferences. She is known, defined, and loved because of her eccentric tastes in culture and passion for fashion couture. She makes it her duty to always flaunt her quirkiness and concentricity in everything that she does in an excessively extravagant way that still works somehow. May it be the way she speaks and behaves, and even in the face of her own death. She also has an affinity for divination magic, specifically with practices and spells that deal with the truth. Myrtle also possesses an unwavering loyalty for the coven that she even decided to refrain from marrying just so she can serve the coven with her full strength until the day that she dies. She wouldn't think twice of hurting those who dare to threaten the congregation that she's spent all of the years of her life on. Due to her obssession with the truth, she's developed a hatred for Fiona Goode who's known to scheme and lie her way out of the crimes that she's done. She also has a bit of a naught side as she's not above using magic for her own personal gain. Her most renowned offensive modus operandi is cooking and having dinner with people she considers enemies either to poison them and later kill them, like what she did with her ex-colleauges Quentin Fleming and Cecily Pembroke, or to gather information, like what she did with Ariel Augustus and Baldwin Pennypacker. She also treats Cordelia as if she was her own daughter, becoming the mother figure that Cordelia never had in Fiona.

        Character Analysis:
        <br>
		Marie Laveau is the most powerful Voodoo Queen to have ever walked the earth. Much like Fiona, she couldn't accept the idea of death and made a deal with Papa Legba who asked her to sacrifice a newborn baby to him every year to keep her immortality with the first of the many sacrifices being Marie's very own child, which was traumatic for Marie. She obliged to his wishes and lived for as long as almost 300 years, although remorsefully but she couldn't seem to give up her immortality for the sake of her own conscience. Marie Laveau was quite a vengeful individual as well. She quickly takes revenge on those who do her wrong with the most extreme and brutal methods available to her. Marie also despises the descendants of the witches from the Salem Witch Trials as she believes that the power they enjoy now is the result of the sweat off the Voodoists' backs. This hatred quickly turns into respect after the Supreme of the Salem Witch coven agrees to take her in after the witch hunter Hank Foxx stormed her hair salon and killed her followers save Queenie. Marie even agrees to work with Fiona after this act of 'kindness'.

        <br>
        Name: Delphine LaLaurie
  		<br>
        Portrayed by: Kathy Bates
        <br>
  		Species: Immortal human
  		<br>
        Personality type: ESTJ 1w2
        <br>
  		Powers and abilities:
        	<dl>
                <dt>Immortality</dt>
                <dd>- gained through drinking a potion made with Marie Laveau's tears; makes a person immune to aging and sickness but still susceptible to bodily harm</dd>
            </dl>
        <br>
        Character Analysis:
        <br>
        Madame Delphine LaLaurie was a high-society socialite back in the 1830s. She was extremely prejudiced and cruel against the African-American people that she enslaved to work for her. Apart from that, she is also a sadist who has a twisted fascination with the sciences of the human anatomy. She'd revel in this fascination by subjecting a number of her slaves to torture and grotesque experimentation in her attic. She consistently did these 'experiments' on African-American slaves only as she viewed them as no better than animals. She even came up with a beauty concoction made from the pancreas of her mutilated slaves that she regularly smeared on her face as she falsely believed that it would keep her young-looking. Her treatment towards her slaves was so cruel that it violated the Code Noir, a decree that depicts the legal implications of owning black slaves, which was already cruel in itself. 
        <br>
        Apart from her sadism and racism, Delphine is also extremely arrogant and narcissistic, believing herself to be better than everyone else in every aspect. She's also a bit of a control freak and would be furious at the instance of someone undermining her authority. Despite her notoriety, however, Delphine has a softer side. She has a deep love for her daughters although she is abusive towards them for the most part. She is also capable of remorse as proven by the time that she verbally admitted that she felt guilty for the vicious crime of killing a child that his husband had with a female slave. Delphine was also shown to be redeemable from her prejudiced views and that she isn't a lost cause. During the time she spent with Queenie, she managed to get educated and her prejudices were seemingly eliminated up to the point that Queenie betrayed her and surrendered her to Marie Laveau.

        <br>
        Name: Kyle Spencer
  		<br>
        Portrayed by: Evan Peters
        <br>
  		Species: Resurrected human
  		<br>
        Personality type: ISFJ 9w1
        <br>
  		Powers and abilities:
        	<dl>
                <dt>Enhanced strength</dt>
                <dd>- after his resurrection, Kyle possessed physical strength that surpasses that of a normal human</dd>
                <dt>Enhanced durability</dt>
                <dd>- after his resurrection, Kyle seemed much more enduring of physical trauma. He's also immune to the Black Widow ability</dd>
            </dl>
        <br>
        Character Analysis:
        <br>
       	Not much can be said about his character after his resurrection as his almost catatonic state prevented him from showcasing anything that can be used to build a profile on him. Before his death, however, Kyle was a caring, sweet, and outgoing boy. At first glance, one can understanbly mistake him as the usual arrogant, proud, self-absorbed, animalistic frat boy, but he's actually much more than that. Kyle was extremely active in charity and payed adequate attention to his academics and his scholarship, signifying that he's kind and responsible. He's also well-behaved and even established rules for his fraternity brothers at the party. Kyle also has a righteous moral compass as he became enraged at the sight of his fraternity brothers gang raping a drugged Madison Montgomery.
